Recreating Pokemon Ruby to the Roblox game engine (engine only, no ROM)
***EXTREMELY INCOMPLETE*** (<1000 lines as of writing)

## Notes & Warnings:
 - **DO NOT** use *MY* code as an example. I am still learning, and I know that my code is almost never optimised.
I am always learning throughout this project, so things will be inconsistent.

 - This is **NOT** a direct port. That would be pretty much impossible. Even though i would love to make a gba emulator, doing that is WAYYY out of my skill range to be able to do that. As of now, i'm sticking to pure recreation. 

 - This project started as a means to challenge myself. How? Roblox's 2D engine. Roblox doesn't have a fantastical 2D engine, so I thought maybe I could try and recreate a really good 2D game that I own in that engine (I don't know how this came to mind - my mind is weird)

 - In the next section, I will talk about how the game's assets are going to be stored. I need to first say that if you get ahold of any patch that contains any '_MACOSX' folder, or any other folder relating to unix, that is because my main computers as of now are unix systems. Final releases should have this removed, but if you see any folder like this, just remove it. It's just there to help MACOSX keep folders in a certain position (i think)

## Game link
The game may be moved from my group to my profile in the future, so if you'd like to join, please go to the github wiki and go to official sites & pages.
Please note that the game is unplayable. Literately. I've added a badge which you can only get for successfully loading the game with an unreleased patch, and even if you do, there isn't much to do other than look at my work. If you'd like to look at my work without trying to reverse engineer a patch, you can join the discord server, which is also in the wiki, where i'll upload screenshots of my work when I feel like it's ready enough.

## Assets:
This game will require installing a patch to the Roblox internal game files. This process will differ between Windows & Mac, but there are tutorials on how to in the discord below.
The reason you need to install a patch is because this is the way I am trying to get past copyright. All of the copyrighted assets are not hosted on Roblox and instead in the patch, which makes the assets unnaccesible for regular users. Therefore, because the assets are NOT stored anywhere within the game code, I am essentially (theoretically) voiding copyright.

 - If I ever get a takedown request from TPCi, or if roblox takes it down, I will keep it that way. Unfortunately, I don't want to ever be sued (sorry to dissapoint)

(I am not a lawyer. If you are a lawyer, please let me know if this'd work)

Please join the discord server if you'd like to play the game / talk about this game w/ me and some others maybe:

## Support me!
There is currently no way to support me as this is only a passion project I started for fun, and I don't think i need any support atm.
There will not be any monetization for the game. This is because the game is literately ripping off a very much still copyrighted series, and even though i'm trying to bypass it, it would feel wrong if I profitted off of a trademark (that and, i'm not sure if this game will get much if any recognition online)



# request
pls add linux support to roblox - it would make my life 1000 times easier (i'm doing this on macbook and my workflow would definetly skyrocket if I could work on my pc (not that I hate macos, its just more convenient to be able to do it on a bigger screen at home))
