Recreating Pokemon Ruby in the Roblox game engine (engine only, no ROM)

## Note:
Please do not use my code as an example. I am not necessarily a good programmer and when it comes to translating another person's work, it usually isn't for me. I am doing this solely as a passion project.

### Assets:
This game will require installing a patch to the Roblox internal game files. This process will differ between Windows & Mac, but there are tutorials on how to in the discord below.
The reason you need to install a patch is because this is the way I am trying to get past copyright. All of the copyrighted assets are not hosted on Roblox and instead in the patch, which makes the assets unnaccesible for regular users. Therefore, because the assets are NOT anywhere publically, I am essentially voiding copyright.

(I am not a lawyer. If you are a lawyer, please let me know if this'd work)

Please join the discord server if you'd like to join (and install the patch).

## This project is incredibly incomplete
I only started a few days ago (as of 5th July 2023)
This means that literately only a few hundred lines are actually written.

### THIS IS NOT A DIRECT PORT
Exactly porting Pokemon Ruby to Roblox is basically impossible. It would be, theoretically, but there are features like proper image masking that Roblox simply doesn't support. I started this project to see if i could challenge myself with these limitations. (Yes, I know roblox is capable of a lot of things, but it is primarily a 3D engine, not a 2D one)
