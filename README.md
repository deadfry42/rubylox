Recreating Pokemon Ruby to the Roblox game engine (engine only, no ROM)  
***EXTREMELY INCOMPLETE*** (<1000 lines as of writing)

## Notes & Warnings:
 - **DO NOT** use *MY* code as an example. I am still learning, and I know that my code is almost never optimised.
I am always learning throughout this project, so things will be inconsistent.

 - This is **NOT** a direct port. That would be pretty much impossible. Even though i would love to make a gba emulator, doing that is WAYYY out of my skill range to be able to do that. As of now, i'm sticking to pure recreation. 

 - This project started as a means to challenge myself. How? Roblox's 2D engine. Roblox doesn't have a fantastical 2D engine, so I thought maybe I could try and recreate a really good 2D game that I own in that engine (I don't know how this came to mind - my mind is weird)

 - Basically everything in this game will be kinda jank, and not 100% accurate. This is because i'm not too sure on how to translate frames to task.wait()s, and also i have no idea where to find delays. Most things are completely eyeballed, so if you are kind enough to help fix some of these issues, please submit a pull request.

 - In the next section, I will talk about how the game's assets are going to be stored. I need to first say that if you get ahold of any patch that contains any '_MACOSX' folder, or any other folder relating to unix, that is because I use osx and linux. Final releases should have this removed, but if you see any folder like this, just remove it. It's just there to help MACOSX keep folders in a certain position (i think)

## Game link
I've recently moved the game to my profile, so all updates will go there.
IF you'd like to play (which you can't), you can join at the game link provided in the wiki. The wiki page is always up to date so it's simply the best place to put it.

Please note that the game is unplayable. Literally. I've added a badge which you can only get for successfully loading the game with a patch, and even if you do, there isn't much to do other than look at my work. If you'd like to look at my work without installing anything, you can join the discord server, which is also in the wiki, where i'll upload screenshots of my work when I feel like it's ready enough.

## Assets:
This game will require installing a patch to the Roblox internal game files. This process will differ between Windows, Mac and Linux, but there are tutorials on how to in the discord below.
The reason you need to install a patch is because this is the way I am trying to get past copyright. All of the copyrighted assets are not hosted on Roblox and instead in the patch, which makes the assets unnaccesible for regular users. Therefore, because the assets are NOT stored anywhere within the game code, I am essentially (theoretically) voiding copyright.

 - If I ever get a takedown request from TPCi, or if roblox takes it down, I will keep it that way. Unfortunately, I don't want to ever be sued (sorry to dissapoint)

(I am not a lawyer. If you are a lawyer, please let me know if this'd work)

Please join the discord server if you'd like to play the game / talk about this game w/ me and some others maybe:

## Support me!
There is currently no way to support me as this is only a passion project I started for fun, and I don't think i need any support atm.
There will not be any monetization for the game. This is because the game is literately ripping off a very much still copyrighted series, and even though i'm trying to bypass it, it would feel wrong if I profitted off of a trademark (that and, i'm not sure if this game will get much if any recognition online)



# request
pls add linux support to roblox - it would make my life 1000 times easier
ik vinegar exists, but its far too buggy to be considered usable
